In these projects I either pursued an interesting line of inquiry or devised a tool I thought would be useful. They were built with **R**, **Python**, **MySQL**, **Excel VBA**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, or some combination of them, and skills learned in [**courses**](https://carlosror.github.io/course_index) taken on the [edX](https://github.com/carlosror/course_index) or [Coursera](https://github.com/carlosror/course_index) platforms.

## Data analysis, exploration, and visualization

#### [Boricuas in the NCAA: 2019-2020 yearbook of Puerto Rico women's college volleyball in the U.S.A.](https://github.com/carlosror/Boricuas_NCAA_Season_Summary_2019_2020)

Inspired by the SI yearbooks for college and pro sports, the project documents the performance of Puerto Rico's college volleyball players throughout the United States. Maps were created using **R**, while the [document itself](https://github.com/carlosror/Boricuas_NCAA_Season_Summary_2019_2020/raw/master/Women/Final_doc_compressed.pdf), to a vast extent, was created using the **Python** API for Scribus, a desktop publishing software.

The data is from the [Center for Retirement Research at Boston College](https://publicplansdata.org/about/our-research/), which tracks 180 pension funds across the United States. The performance of the fund is also compared to those of other large funds.

The app also illustrates the most popular majors among male and female students, as well as the most selective ones overall. In addition, the most frequent high schools of provenance of those admitted to a campus and the top performing schools in Puerto Rico are also graphed.

### Crime maps

  These interactive maps plot police activity within a given radius of a location. The user can specify types of incidents, days of week, and times of day to refine results. Each of them also displays density maps, faceted bar plots, and contingency tables. They were put together using using **R** and **Shiny server**, while the data was pre-processed using **Python**.
