## Data visualizations

#### [Interactive visualization of performance of Puerto Rican high schools in 2013-2014](https://github.com/carlosror/tasas-graduaciones)

  Interactive visualization of the graduation rates of all public high schools in Puerto Rico, across regions, districts, and cities
  
#### [Interactive visualization of 5 years of University of Puerto Rico admissions data](https://carlosgg.shinyapps.io/admisiones-upr/)

  An interactive web app created using ~69,000 records from Puerto Rico's Open Data Portal, corresponding to students admitted to the UPR campuses over a 5-year period. The app helps educators and future applicants visualize the qualifications of students admitted to a given UPR campus in a given year. The app also illustrates the most popular majors among male and female students, as well as the most selective ones overall. In addition, the most frequent high schools of provenance of those admitted to a campus and the top performing schools in Puerto Rico are also graphed.
  
### Crime maps

  These interactive maps plot police activity within a given radius of a location. The user can specify types of incidents, days of week, and times of day to refine results. The application also displays density maps, faceted bar plots, and contingency tables.

## EE

#### [PLL design tool](https://github.com/carlosror/pll3rdorder)

  Web-based 3rd-order PLL design tool in Python/Javascript. Computes loop filter
components’ values, plots open­ and closed-­loop responses and output­-referred noise
plots, computes RMS phase and frequency errors and jitter, plots time response, and
computes various lock times. Plots and tabulates extensive results to web page or, alternatively,
generates complete Excel report for download and further computations. The website is
available in simplified Chinese as well by clicking on the top right of the page

#### [Smith Chart impedance matching tool](http://thesmithchart.appspot.com)

  Web-based Smith chart impedance matching tool using jQuery and HTML Canvas aids
designer to match a given impedance ZL at a given frequency to a given characteristic
impedance Zo. Computes equivalent input impedance and reflection coefficient
amplitude and phase and plots on the Smith Chart. Can use Z, Y, or ZY Smith charts.
