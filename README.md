In these projects I either pursued an interesting line of inquiry or devised a tool I thought would be useful. They were built with **R**, **Python**, **MySQL**, **Excel VBA**, **Javascript**, **jQuery**, or some combination of them, and skills learned in [**courses**](https://carlosror.github.io/course_index) taken on the [edX](https://github.com/carlosror/course_index) or [Coursera](https://github.com/carlosror/course_index) platforms.

  An interactive web app created using ~69,000 records from Puerto Rico's Open Data Portal, corresponding to students admitted to the UPR campuses over a 5-year period, using **R** and **Shiny server**. The app helps educators and future applicants visualize the qualifications of students admitted to a given UPR campus in a given year. The app also illustrates the most popular majors among male and female students, as well as the most selective ones overall. In addition, the most frequent high schools of provenance of those admitted to a campus and the top performing schools in Puerto Rico are also graphed.

#### [PLL design tool](http://pll3rdorder.appspot.com/) [<img src="github_icon.png">](https://github.com/carlosror/pll3rdorder)

  A colorful 3<sup>rd</sup>-order PLL design tool in Python/Javascript. Computes loop filter
components’ values, plots open- and closed-loop responses and output-referred noise
plots, computes RMS phase and frequency errors and jitter, plots time response, and
computes various lock times. Plots and tabulates extensive results to web page or, alternatively,
generates complete Excel report for download and further computations. The app is
available in Simplified Chinese as well. [体验一下吧](http://pll3rdorder.appspot.com/zw). The app is hosted on **Google App Engine**. In the backend, the app uses **Python** and the modules **numpy**, **xlrd**, and **xlwt**, and the **Jinja2** templating engine. In the front end, it uses the **HTML5** stack: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**, plus **Google Charts**.

#### [Smith Chart impedance matching tool](http://thesmithchart.appspot.com)

  A vibrant Smith chart impedance matching tool hosted on **Google App Engine** and using **jQuery** and **HTML Canvas** that aids
designers to match a given impedance Z<sub>L</sub> at a given frequency to a given characteristic
impedance Z<sub>o</sub>. Computes equivalent input impedance and reflection coefficient
amplitude and phase and plots on the Smith Chart. Can use Z, Y, or ZY Smith charts.
